shishu_.repo_local_manifests
========================

Local Manifests needed to sync all surnia sources (and avoid use of romname.dependencies by now.)

##How to use it?

You have to use my script (right click on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aidonnou-surnia/shishu_.repo_local_manifests/rr_nougat/autoscript.sh). You have to save it on the folder you want to sync the rom.)

##And after that?
you have to do 
```
bash autoscript.sh
```
on the folder you want to sync (again, ensure you have the script saved on this folder to execute it and do that stuff automatically)
